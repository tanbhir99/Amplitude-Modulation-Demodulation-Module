# Amplitude-Modulation-Demodulation-Module
This is a low cost trainer module to teach and demonstrate the students or trainees about the basics of Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation. Generally, the available trainer kits are expensive and most of the time the additional features are not required to demonstrate and teach the basics. On the other hand, most of the under developed university labs are not able to afford these expenses to buy these trainer kits. Therefore, this project could be a low cost solution to these educational labs to demostrate the basics of Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation.
